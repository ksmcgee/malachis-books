                    <p>"Wait... is that really Aunt Kat AND Aunt Lydia together?! This can't be real!"</p>
                    <p>And then you did the most precious thing - you started pinching yourself, over and over, like you were trying to wake up from the most amazing dream. But baby, I was doing the same thing in my heart, because after all these years, I was finally here with you for your birthday trip.</p>

                    <p>At the trampoline park, I couldn't take my eyes off you. Not because you jumped so high, but because of how you made every single kid feel like they mattered.</p>
                    <p>I watched you notice a little girl who looked scared and walk right over to her. "Want to jump with me?" you asked, and suddenly she was giggling. You checked on the smaller kids, made sure no one felt left out, and your smile - oh, Malachi, your smile was like sunshine.</p>
                    <p>Standing there watching you be kind to everyone, I felt so proud I could barely breathe. That's my nephew, I thought. That beautiful, caring boy is mine to love.</p>

                    <p>You attacked that chicken with pure joy, but when you hit those potatoes and carrots, your face was priceless:</p>
                    <p>"Aunt Kat, these potatoes are way too hard and these carrots are way too soft! Who made these?"</p>
                    <p>Even when you didn't like something, you were so polite about it. You didn't make a fuss or complain - you just stated the facts like a little food critic. That's who you are, Malachi - thoughtful and kind, even about disappointing vegetables.</p>

                    <p>You started sitting up straight, crunching those chips with determination. Then slowly, so slowly, gravity started winning. You slid down in your seat, the chips getting slower... and slower... until your hand just stopped moving.</p>
                    <p>Then, just ten minutes later: "Y'all told me to take a nap, and I did!"</p>
                    <p>You popped up like a jack-in-the-box, announcing your successful completion of nap time with the pride of someone who'd just climbed Mount Everest.</p>
